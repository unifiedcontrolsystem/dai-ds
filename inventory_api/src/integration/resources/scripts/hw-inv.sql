-- HW_Location is always an element of an array.
-- HW_Location type is not necessarily the same as Field_Replaceble_Unit type.  They only need to be compatible.
-- There is a 1 to 1 onto relationship between subset(HW_Location) and subset(Field_Replaceble_Unit).
--   We represent the vacancy of an empty slot as UCS-PLACEHOLDER-<ID>.
-- Note that FOREIGN KEY constraint is not supported.
--   This can create some sloppiness when referencing HW locations from another table.
-- The HW_Location primary key also serves as a path to the FRU in the HPC organization hierarchy.

-- Unfortunately, a 1 table implementation is not possible because VoltDB
-- is not ANSI-compliant.  You cannot have multiple NULL values in a UNIQUE column.
