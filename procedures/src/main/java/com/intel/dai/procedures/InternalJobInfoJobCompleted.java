/**
 * Handle the database processing that is necessary in the InternalJobInfo table when a job has completed.
 * Note: this method must handle the fact that in this environment, time is NOT a stream, i.e., records may show up that are out of time order.
 *
 *  Input parameter:
 *      String  sJobId              = string containing the WLM job id
 *      String  sWorkDir            = string containing the job's working directory
 *      String  sWlmJobState        = string containing the job's WLM Job State.
 *      long    lEndTsInMicroSecs   = time this job ended in units of micro-seconds since the epoch
 *      long    lStartTsInMicroSecs = this is the time that this job completion record thinks that the job started, in units of micro-seconds since the epoch
 *
 *  Return value:
 *      VoltTable aJobInfo = VoltTable containing all of the JobInfo for this job (after updating it to reflect the fact that the job has completed)
